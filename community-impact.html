                NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, plays a crucial role in advancing our
                understanding of astrophysics by conducting various space missions and collecting vast amounts
                of scientific data related to celestial bodies, galaxies, and the universe as a whole. After
                understanding the impacts of open science the research scholars will get detailed explanation of
                the opportunities for research in astrophysics using NASA's scientific information.
