        <div class="heading">Increased Collaboration :</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Open science will encourage greater collaboration among researchers,
                both within and across disciplines. This collaboration can lead to more innovative and
                comprehensive solutions to complex problems.
            </p>

        <div class="heading">Open Access Publishing :</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Open access journals and repositories will continue to grow, ensuring
                that research findings are freely available to the global scientific community and the public.
                This promotes transparency and equitable access to knowledge.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="heading">Data Sharing :</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                The sharing of research data will become more common, making it easier for
                scientists to build upon each other's work. This will lead to more robust and reproducible
                research.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="heading">Transparency and Reproducibility :</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Open science practices will prioritize transparency, making
                research methods, data, and code openly accessible. This will enhance the reproducibility of
                scientific studies.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="heading">Citizen Science :</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Open science will involve more citizen scientists and the general public in
                data collection and analysis. This can lead to the democratization of scientific research and
                increased public engagement.

        </div>
        <div class="heading">Preprints and Rapid Dissemination :</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Preprint servers will play a significant role in quickly
                sharing research findings before formal peer review. This can accelerate the dissemination of
                knowledge.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading">Alternative Metrics :</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Traditional impact factors may be complemented or replaced by alternative
                metrics that better reflect the broader impact of research, such as citations, downloads, and
                societal relevance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading">Open Educational Resources :</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Open educational resources (OER) will become more prevalent,
                reducing the cost of educational materials and increasing access to quality education.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading">Policy Changes :</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Governments and funding agencies are likely to implement policies that require
                researchers to adopt open science practices, further driving its adoption.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="heading">Ethical Considerations :</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                As open science advances, ethical concerns related to data privacy,
                security, and intellectual property will need to be carefully addressed.
