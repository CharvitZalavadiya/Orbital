            <p>
                The reluctance to share work flow and the continuing practices and to share data as a research paper
                scientist conclude it as a waste of time .
                Furthermore , it will take a long haul where for their credits to return in the form of benefits. This
                deteriorate their priority to switch to new model of publication.

        <h4>What are the Challanges of Open Science ?</h4>
        <div class="heading">Intellectual Property</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Open science can give the real tension related to patent right and intellectual property in the current
                system it can create privacy issues.
                The actual concern rises with the e right to commercial exploitation and its protection through
                intellectual property rights (IPR), mainly patents.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fields where intellectual property rights and patents are crucial, open science may be perceived as a
                threat to innovation and commercialization. Researchers and organizations may be less inclined to invest
                in research if they cannot protect their discoveries.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="heading">Ethical Culture</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Open science can raise ethical dilemmas, such as how to handle data that could potentially be used for
                harmful purposes.
                It can also raise issues to violation of raising of fundamental ethical principle of privacy of the
                unaware community of people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Changing the culture and practices of scientific research institutions can be slow and challenging. Some
                institutions may have longstanding traditions and practices that are resistant to change.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="heading">Credit for the Research</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Researchers might be worried that they won't receive proper credit for their work. As the content can be
                copied and re erased and can be published under someone elseâ€™s name and the credit is transferred.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also,traditional academic publishing remains a dominant metric for assessing researchers' productivity
                and impact. Openly sharing research data, code, or preprints may not receive the same recognition as
                peer-reviewed publications, which can affect researchers' career advancement and funding prospects.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="heading">Competitive Benefits</div>
        <div class="content">
            Some argue that providing research findings for a period can provide a competitive advantage,this can lead
            to patent issues.
            In competitive research environments, the fear of giving others a competitive advantage may deter
            researchers or organizations from fully embracing open science. They may be concerned that sharing data or
            findings openly could compromise their position in the field.
        </div>

        <div class="heading">Cultural Changing Issues</div>
        <div class="content">
            Not all researchers and institutions are ready to change as it will require coordinative policy , incentive
            and normative changes and to convince such a wide group of people it will take enormous time.
            Changing the culture and practices of scientific research institutions can be slow and challenging. Some
            institutions may have longstanding traditions and practices that are resistant to change.
