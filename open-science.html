            <p>Open science is the movement to make scientific research an unhindered access transforming its reach to
                infinite . It empowers the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge within the scientific
                community
                and enhances wider public to accelerate scientific research and understandings.
            </p>

                It escalates the collaborative culture ,embracing future development in technology that holds its stakes
                upon opening the chattels of sciences. Open science is a commitment to stand with important questions
                that
                don't stand alone.

        <div class="heading"><b>Why Open Science ?</b></div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Broadens participation and fosters greater collaboration in scientific investigations by lowering the
                barriers to entry into scientific exploration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generates greater impact and more citations to scientific results.

        <h4>Advantages of the Open Science</h4>
        <div class="heading">Efficiency</div>
        <div class="content">
            The research would be visible to a wider audience and thus if any human errors available in the research it
            can be evaluated. At the time of writing the research paper there are a sequential number of work that has
            to published but these will eventually lead to few errors that can create huge errors.Open science can lead
            to the more efficient allocation of resources in research. Researchers can build on existing knowledge,
            reducing redundancy and optimizing research efforts.

        <div class="heading">Quality and integrity</div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Open access to scientific research, data and other assets will support the research process and will
                offer an opportunity of a broader perspective evaluation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Open science encourages researchers to be transparent about their methods, data, and findings. This
                transparency makes it easier for others to scrutinize and replicate the research, promoting the
                reliability and reproducibility of scientific results. When research is conducted openly, it's more
                likely to withstand rigorous scrutiny and verification.

            Open Science can reduce delays and will promote hierarchical search of results including articles and data
            sets.

        <div class="heading">Global benefits</div>
        <div class="content">
            Open Science is inevitably international, and it must provide ways to communicate in broader world
            perspectives. Open science transcends geographical boundaries and allows researchers from around the world
            to contribute to and access scientific knowledge. This global collaboration can lead to diverse perspectives
            and a richer pool of expertise.

        <div class="heading">Public disclosure and engagement</div>
        <div class="content">
            science should be open for the whole society, and as no question stand alone it will give opportunity to
            enhance more questions.Open science helps bridge the gap between the scientific community and the general
            public. When research findings are openly accessible, it becomes easier for the public to understand, engage
            with, and support scientific endeavors.
